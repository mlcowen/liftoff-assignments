## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project will be an web application that serves as a restaurant guide in the St. Louis, Mo area. Users will be able to look for restaurants based on the type of food that they want. Users will also be able to add restaurants to a "to-do" style list that can be filtered by categories. The goal would be to make dining out selections easier and faster. 

I am a foodie and like to go check out different restaurants in St. Louis, which lead to the idea of this application.

### Features

- Create and edit restaurants: Users will be able to create/add restaurants to the application and edit their entries. 
  
- View details: Users will be able to view details about the restaurants including hours of operations, address, reviews, and links to social media page. 

- Create reviews: Users will be able to create reviews on the restaurants. They will also be able to add a photo (optional) to their review. 

- List of restaurants: User will be able to view a list of all restaurants that are in the application. 

- Delete restaurants: Users will be able to delete restaurants. 

- Create custom "to-do" list: Users will be able to save and categorize a list of restaurants that they would like to visit.
  

### Technologies

- C#

- Bootstrap CSS & JS

- EntityFramework Core / SQL
  
- Unit Testing (Stretch Goal)

### What I'll Have to Learn

My main goal is to solidify my understanding of the .NET framework and to brush up on core concepts required in the programming field. 

I'll have to learn Boostrap 4 and the bundled JavaScript components. Additionally, I would like to implement an autocomplete input box that uses Bootstrap for styling. 

I'll also have to learn how to upload and store photos for the review section. 

Stretch Goal: I do not know how to write unit tests for my code so I'll have to learn how to do this. However, I think this will be valuable real world experience.
